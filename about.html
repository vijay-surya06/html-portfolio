<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Vijay Surya S, a second-year student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, pursuing a degree in<br />
 Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). Ever since I dismantled my first radio to see<br />
 how it worked, I've been captivated by the world of electronics and communication technology.</p>

<p>At Amrita University, I have had the opportunity to dive deep into subjects like digital signal processing,<br />
 microcontrollers, and communication systems. Iâ€™ve particularly enjoyed hands-on<br />
 projects in my lab classes, where I've designed and built circuits and worked on small-scale communication systems.</p>

<p>Outside of my studies, I am passionate about robotics.Looking forward, I am eager to explore internships and research opportunities to further my<br />
 knowledge and skills in the ECE field. My ultimate goal is to contribute to advancements in<br />
 communication technology that can make a real difference in people's lives.<br />
 I am always keen to connect with fellow enthusiasts and professionals in the field.<br />
